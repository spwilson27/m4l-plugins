# Ableton MCP Bridge — Pass 1 bug sweep (red tests only, no fixes)

- Worktree: /tmp/bugsweep/mcp-bridge
- Branch: bugsweep/mcp-bridge-pass1 (base HEAD 66fea67)
- Scope read in full: AGENTS.md section 13 (Architecture of devices/Ableton MCP Bridge.amxd), src/ableton_mcp_node.js (297 lines), src/ableton_mcp_lom.js (799 lines), scripts/ableton_mcp_server.js (621 lines), scripts/build_ableton_mcp.py, tests/test_ableton_mcp.js.
- Baseline on unmodified HEAD: node tests/test_ableton_mcp.js -> PASS (exit 0).
- No production code was changed. No Live, Max, or MCP session was started on this machine; every test below is plain Node.

## BUG-MCP-1: delete_device with no target calls delete_device(-1) on live_set instead of erroring

- Where: src/ableton_mcp_lom.js, handleDeleteDevice (lines 422-445), with makeApi (line 79). The MCP tool schema in scripts/ableton_mcp_server.js (lines 214-235) declares no required fields for ableton_delete_device, so an empty-arguments call is valid at the MCP layer and reaches this handler.
- Evidence: with neither path nor parentPath/deviceIndex, parentPath stays empty and deviceIndex stays -1. makeApi on an empty target silently substitutes live_set, and the handler unconditionally runs parentApi.call("delete_device", -1) and returns deleted: true.
- Expected: a validation error (ok: false) and no delete_device call at all.
- Actual (red run): reply was {"ok":true,"result":{"deleted":true,"parent_path":"","device_index":-1,"result":"ok"}}.
- Red test: tests/test_ableton_mcp.js block 3, BUG-MCP-1 (vm sandbox with mock LiveAPI, same style as the existing LOM tests).

## BUG-MCP-2: set_device_parameter without a numeric value writes NaN to the parameter

- Where: src/ableton_mcp_lom.js, handleSetDeviceParameter (lines 380-420); the clamp is line 408: Math.max(targetParam.min, Math.min(targetParam.max, Number(p.value))).
- Evidence: the handler validates path but never validates value. With value missing or non-numeric, Number(p.value) is NaN, the clamp returns NaN, and paramApi.set("value", NaN) is executed. The HTTP /rpc surface in src/ableton_mcp_node.js performs no argument validation either, so the LOM executor is the last line of defense.
- Expected: a validation error (ok: false) and no set call.
- Actual (red run): reply was ok: true for a call with paramIndex 1 and no value; the captured set call received NaN (the reply re-read shows the old mock value because the mock get is static).
- Red test: tests/test_ableton_mcp.js block 3, BUG-MCP-2.

## BUG-MCP-3: transport with an unknown action reports success while doing nothing

- Where: src/ableton_mcp_lom.js, handleTransport (lines 447-466).
- Evidence: the action string is matched against play/stop/continue/undo/redo and every other value falls through silently; the handler then returns handleGetSessionInfo() as a successful result. A typo or bogus action sent over /rpc (where no tool schema enum applies) is indistinguishable from a real transport command.
- Expected: ok: false for an unrecognized action (a tempo-only call with no action remains legitimate).
- Actual (red run): action bogus_action returned ok: true with full session info.
- Red test: tests/test_ableton_mcp.js block 3, BUG-MCP-3.

## BUG-MCP-4: POST /rpc with a valid-JSON null body crashes the Node bridge

- Where: src/ableton_mcp_node.js, /rpc handler (lines 170-191), dereference at line 182: String(body.action || "ping") and line 183 body.params.
- Evidence: JSON.parse succeeds for the body null (and for other non-object JSON values), but the handler assumes an object. A null body throws TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading action) inside the async end handler; the unhandled rejection terminates the Node process, so the HTTP client gets no response at all and the bridge is down until Max restarts the codebox.
- Expected: an HTTP error response with ok: false (for example 400), and the bridge stays alive and healthy.
- Actual (red run): no HTTP response; child process stderr showed the TypeError at src/ableton_mcp_node.js:182 and the process exited.
- Red test: tests/test_ableton_mcp_stdio_http.js, BUG-MCP-4 (spawns the real bridge on test port 19931 via the global.__MAX_API_MOCK__ fallback; no Live needed).

## BUG-MCP-5: stdio MCP server silently swallows invalid JSON instead of returning a -32700 parse error

- Where: scripts/ableton_mcp_server.js, stdin loop (lines 556-569): both the Content-Length branch and the newline branch wrap JSON.parse plus handleJsonRpcMessage in try { } catch (_) { }.
- Evidence: a malformed line is consumed and dropped with no response. JSON-RPC 2.0 requires a parse error response with code -32700 and id null; without it, a client that sent a damaged frame waits forever for a reply that never comes.
- Expected: one JSON-RPC error message {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":null,"error":{"code":-32700,...}} and the server keeps serving later valid messages.
- Actual (red run): after the invalid line, the only response seen was the later valid ping reply {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":99,"result":{}}; no parse error was emitted.
- Red test: tests/test_ableton_mcp_stdio_http.js, BUG-MCP-5 (spawns the real stdio server as a child process).

## Red run summary (2026-10-24, this worktree)

- node tests/test_ableton_mcp.js -> exit 1. Pre-existing blocks 1-2 pass; new block 3 reports exactly 3 failures: BUG-MCP-1, BUG-MCP-2, BUG-MCP-3 (each: expected ok:false, got ok:true).
- node tests/test_ableton_mcp_stdio_http.js -> exit 1. Exactly 2 failures: BUG-MCP-4 (no HTTP response, TypeError crash at ableton_mcp_node.js:182) and BUG-MCP-5 (no -32700 response).
- No other failures. Nothing in src/ or scripts/ was modified.
